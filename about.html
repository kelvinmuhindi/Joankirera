          Speaker, <span>Therapist,</span> <span>Mental Health Educator</span>
        </h2>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          I started my career by pursuing a professional course in Electrical and Electronics Engineering – telecommunications option at the Kenya Polytechnic (now Technical University of Nairobi) and practiced for a few years.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          While working in "electricity construction", I interacted with people who shared very intimate details of their lives yet I did not know how to help them. Sometimes I would just listen, other times I would advise or just pray with them. These experiences made me question my methods of helping.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          I fellowshipped in a church in the city where we had many people who visited just once, and in many occasions, these walk-in members would pull me aside and share their lives – the kind of deep sharing you do not expect from people meeting you for the first time. This got me thinking about what to do in order to be a better helper to these many people who seemed to trust me.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          I had a talk with the pastor who walked me the journey of understanding my purpose. She asked me to consider taking psychology so that I could learn the skills, that way I would not just pass my opinions to people but I would understand human behavior.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          Pastor's words did not make any sense to me at the time and it took a while before it all finally made sense. God bless Pastor Sally Githinji who was then a trained marriage and family therapist and was very helpful throughout my training.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          I chose to pursue a diploma course in counseling psychology then specialized in marriage and family therapy and later invested in a bachelor's degree in counseling psychology. The hardest part was the transition from engineering to psychology/marriage and family therapy. There were so many uncertainties, so many fears, so many questions that no one could answer.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fade-in-up">
          The one important decision that helped me to move on is when I started taking a journey from within, a journey towards my emotional healing, personal growth and discovery, a journey of finding myself. This journey was my inner motivation to help others find themselves and this is my life's purpose.
